<h1><b>Spam Mail Prediction using ML</b></h1>
Problem Statement : Developing a predictior that classifies whether a given mail is a spam mail or a ham mail.
Mails can be primarily classified into two categories:
1) Spam Mails : They refer to unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent over the internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purpose of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, or other malicious activities. 
2) Ham Mails : They refer to messages that are solicited or expected by the recipients. These emails are typically relevant, wanted, and come from known or trusted sources.
